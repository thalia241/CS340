How I Write Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

To keep my code maintainable, I followed modular design and clear documentation practices. I reused the same CRUD Python Module from Project One instead of rebuilding database logic. This made my Project Two dashboard easier to update and debug because the database operations are isolated in their own class. I also used descriptive variable names, in-line comments, and consistent indentation so the code is readable by other developers. The CRUD module could easily be reused for other dashboards or analytics projects by changing only the database and collection names. Working in this modular way keeps the program adaptable to future clients or data sources.

How I Approach Problems as a Computer Scientist

When approaching the Grazioso Salvare dashboard requirements, I treated the problem like a software engineer would — by breaking it into smaller tasks. First, I confirmed that the database connection worked with CRUD operations. Then I built the visualization layer in Dash and connected it to MongoDB queries. I tested one component at a time so I could quickly find and fix issues. Compared to earlier assignments, this project required more planning and integration between front-end and back-end systems. In the future, I would apply this same method of modular development and incremental testing when creating other client-facing database applications.

What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters

Computer scientists use problem-solving and technical skills to turn data into useful tools. In this project, my work helps Grazioso Salvare make informed decisions about which dogs are most suitable for different rescue tasks. By organizing and visualizing the data, the dashboard saves time, reduces human error, and supports smarter training choices. Projects like this show why computer science matters — it’s not just about writing code but about designing systems that make organizations more efficient and effective.

This project helped me understand how to connect data, logic, and design into one working application. It taught me how to manage code that interacts with a live database and how to troubleshoot real-world issues like file paths and missing data. More importantly, it showed me how the skills I’m learning in computer science can be applied to meaningful projects that help people and organizations solve real problems.
